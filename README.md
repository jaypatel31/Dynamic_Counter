# Dynamic_Counter #
Dynamic Counter Based on Mysql and PHP
## Working ##
  * User first have to enter the appropriate start time and end time.
  * Now when the current time equals to start time than the timer gets started.
  * Now if you close and rejoin page after sometime you will get to see that the timer will be running with appropriate time left.
  * This happens because the timer gets stored in the database.
  * Also the reset button is available to user if they want to rescheduled the start and end time.
  * When the times get over than user will automatically see the scheduled option on screen.
